%In order to use UK govt bond's you will have to download the bloomberg
%software or have already downloaded the software. In order to download the
%latest software visit hhtp://www.bloomberg.com. Once the software has been
%downloaded in order to configure the software you will have to do as
%follows:
%1. If you have already downloaded blpapi3.jar, find it in a folder such as 
%c:\blp\DAPI\blpapi3.jar or search for it in the Bloomberg installation folder
%c:\blp.If you have not downloaded blpapi3.jar from Bloomberg, download it as follows:
%In the Bloomberg terminal, type WAPI <GO> to open the API Developer's Help Site screen.
%Click API Download Center. Download and install the appropriate software.
%2. Once you have blpapi3.jar on your system you will need to add it to the
%MATLAB java classpath. In order to do so use the javaaddpath function. Use
%the javaaddpath function with the bloomberg API path on your system within
%the brackets e.g. javaaddpath(c:\blp\API\blpapi3.jar)The JAR file path varies
%depending on the installed Bloomberg software.
%Then in order to check whether it has been added to the java classpath type java class path then
%hit enter.
%e.g. javaaddpath(c:\blp\API\blpapi3.jar)
%     java classpath
%if so it should appear in the list of java paths.
